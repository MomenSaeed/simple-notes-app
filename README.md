# Rails Notes coding challenge
**Rails Notes coding challenge** is a coding challenge for Rails developers applying for a job at Pangea Technology.

## Scenario
So here you are! You decided to apply for a job at Pangea and now we are asking you to help us create a Notes App in Rails.

The app should have basic authentication with email and password.
You don't have to store any other information about the user.
Every user can sign up and create notes.
A note has a **title** and a **body**.

The user should be able to see a list of his notes, create new notes and should be able to edit them.

He should be able to collaborate with his friends and edit his notes with them through a link (like in Google Docs).
The user has to see the live updates, however not necessarily the cursors or any other thing. Only the text should change.

Bonus: Add two types of links (view only, view and edit)
Only editing is mandatory.

You don't have to spend a lot of time on styling.
An input field for the title and a text field for the body are enough for the note.
The body should be plain text without markup. (bold, italic etc. are not necessary)

The focus here is on your backend skills.
